				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					You probably haven't been, but I was born in Langhorne, Pennsylvania,
					where 16 years later, my software engineering career would also be
					born.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've always had an addiction to being a part of building businesses
					for as long as I can remember.
				</p>
				<p>
					It started with my dad taking me to mow my grandparent's lawn every
					week before I could drive while selling in-game carries and gold in
					World of Warcraft "on the side" before I eventually started fixing
					people's broken iPhones.
				</p>
				<p>
					But, what better next business for a 16-year-old who: has never
					written a line of code in their life and does not own a Mac than
					launching an iOS app? (For those wondering, a Mac is required for
					writing iOS apps, at least at the time.) Thankfully, I could solve the
					Mac problem with savings from the prior businesses I had done. And,
					since, at the time, I didn't know anyone who knew what code was and I
					couldn't teach myself, I started attending the local community college
					to learn.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few years later, I transferred and graduated from Duquesne
					University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with a Bachelor of Arts in
					Computer Science.
				</p>
				<p>
					I never did launch the app; however, while at Duquesne, I landed my
					first consulting contract to build a Java CLI app from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fast-forward to now: I am currently working at Comcast, primarily
					working on APIs for the Xfinity platform, consulting for SMBs in the
					off-hours, and still writing code as my main hobby.
